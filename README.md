# 🥛 Milk Quality Classification

Welcome to the **Milk Quality Classification** project! This project leverages machine learning to predict the quality of milk based on various features. 🚀

## 🎯 Project Overview

In this project, we:
- **🔍 Preprocess Data:** Load and clean the dataset.
- **🛠️ Train Models:** Build and train machine learning models.
- **📊 Evaluate Models:** Use cross-validation to assess model performance.
- **💾 Save Models:** Save the trained models for future use.
- **📥 Provide Download Option:** Offer a way to download the saved model.

## 📦 Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lithikhaa/Milk_Adulteration.git
   cd Milk_Adulteration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed. Use a virtual environment if preferred.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset:** Place `milk_dataset.csv` in the project directory.
